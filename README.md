# Exercise 4: Scraping Test

Write a Python program to get the number of followers of a specific account on Twitter (taking an URL as an input, for example, [https://twitter.com/KMbappe](https://twitter.com/KMbappe))       


There were problems about Twitter.       
First, I don't live in Thailand and I was locked out of my Twitter account, so I have to create a new email and a new Twitter account.     
I  also have to create an app for authentication tokens, but I have no access to api v1, which the library tweepy is using, and can get follower counts easier.      
So, I had to work around by calling the API manually.           

Although I created an app for the purpose of  this test only, I don't want to include my app token in this repo.   
I tested the code and it runs fine.          
You can test the code by insert your own Bearer token.
